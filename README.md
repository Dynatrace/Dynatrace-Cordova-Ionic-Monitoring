# Dynatrace-Cordova-Ionic-Monitoring
Real user monitoring of Cordova Ionic hybrid mobile applications 

## Getting Started

This section describes how you can install and run this demo application on your own computer or mobile phone.

### Prerequisites

What software you need to install in order to start with installing the application itself:

* Installation of NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Installation of the Ionic CLI through npm (Node Package Manager): Enter in the cmd or terminal "npm install -g ionic" 

### Installation

Now you are ready for the installation of the application.

* Checkout or download the project content
* Installation of all necessary project modules: In the project directory execute the following command - *"npm install"*
* Adding a platform (e.g. Android) - **Not necessary** : Enter the command *"ionic platform add Android"*

**Important:** Especially when adding a platform be sure that you install all necessary platform tools. See https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/ for more information. The Android platform requirements can be found here: http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html. The iOS platform requirements can be found here: http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html

### Start

Depending on the platforms added, the startup looks different. Basically *"ionic serve --lab"* will work all the time, because it does need a platform to be executed. If you want to run the application on iOS or Android simply enter *"ionic run android"* or *"ionic run ios"*. This of course only works when the platform was added in the installation step.

## Instrumentation

The instrumention will be explained in this section. Stay tuned.
